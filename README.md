# random-E11
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model capable of identifying risk factors, clinical patterns, and biomarkers associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

## Project Development
The project will be carried out in three phases, designed to address the construction, implementation, and delivery of the predictive model and its related components.

### Phase One
During this phase, each group will select a complex disease to work on and follow the steps outlined below:

Literature Review:
An exhaustive review of scientific literature will be conducted to understand the factors associated with the selected disease.

Data Collection:
Relevant data on the disease will be gathered from public repositories such as PhysioNet, Gene Expression Omnibus or MetaboLights to ensure a solid foundation for modeling.

Model Training:
Using the collected data, a predictive model will be trained employing advanced machine learning and/or biostatistical techniques.

API Development:
The model will be encapsulated in an API developed with plumber. This API must:

Be documented using Swagger.
Be hosted in a public GitHub repository to enable collaboration and transparency.
Delivery date: 09/12/2024

### Phase Two
In the second phase, projects will be randomly exchanged between groups to promote collaborative work and cross-evaluation. The activities will include:

Front-End Development:
Each group will create a user interface for the assigned disease using Shiny app, ensuring an intuitive and functional user experience.

Issue Management:
Groups will maintain their own GitHub repository, addressing and resolving Issues reported by the group using their API.

Deployment:
The API and the Shiny application will be deployed in two interconnected Docker containers, ensuring seamless integration between both tools.

### Phase Three
In the final phase, groups will focus on the delivery, documentation, and presentation of their project. Activities will include:

Final Documentation:
Each group must prepare comprehensive documentation of their project, including:

A detailed explanation of the methodology.
Instructions for deploying and using the API and front-end.
A summary of the challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
Project Submission:
The complete project, including the source code, documentation, and any additional resources, must be submitted via Campus UB.

Presentation:
Each group will deliver a presentation showcasing their project. The presentation should:

Explain the disease and its relevance.
Demonstrate the functionality of the API and front-end.
Highlight the projectâ€™s impact and potential applications.
Delivery date: 19/12/2024
